# Geospatial Christmas

Decorate your street for Christmas in augmented reality using the Google Geospatial Geometry data.

## Description

The Geospatial Christmas app uses the Google Geospatial Geometry to allow the user to tap on buildings and terrain to place Christmas decorations. 

Tapping on a horizontal surface will place a standard decoration and tapping on a vertical surface will place either the start or end point of some Christmas bunting that will shower the scene with snow. 

## Getting Started

### Installing

There is a working APK [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HTjnYwqluq2lnT-ahW6gBev8oW0q5j5k/view?usp=sharing)

The APK was built with a custom keystore so the ARCore Extensions API key will only work with the built APK above. 

Please enter your own ARCore Extensions API key to build and run the project.
